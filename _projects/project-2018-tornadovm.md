title: "TornadoVM: A Heterogeneous Programming Framework."

<i>(Dec 2018 - now)</i>

[TornadoVM](https://www.tornadovm.org/) is a plug-in to OpenJDK and GraalVM that allows programmers to automatically run Java programs on heterogeneous hardware. TornadoVM currently targets OpenCL-compatible devices and it runs on multi-core CPUs, dedicated GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD), integrated GPUs (Intel HD Graphics and ARM Mali), and FPGAs (Intel and Xilinx).

In this project, I have been involved in the design and implementation of the OpenCL backend that integrates the Xilinx HLS compiler. Additionally, I have managed to run Java workloads on [AWS EC2 instances](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM/blob/master/assembly/src/docs/17_AWS.md).

Code of this project is [open-source](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM).
