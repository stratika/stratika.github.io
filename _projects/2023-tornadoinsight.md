<i>(Feb 2023 - now)</i>

[TornadoInsight](https://github.com/beehive-lab/tornado-insight) is an open source IntelliJ plugin that aims to enhance the experience of developers when working with [TornadoVM](https://www.tornadovm.org/). It provides a built-in on-the-fly static checker, empowering developers to identify unsupported Java features in TornadoVM and understand the reasons behind these limitations. Additionally, it introduces a dynamic testing framework that enables developers to easily test individual TornadoVM tasks. It automatically wraps TornadoVM tasks, invoking the native TornadoVM runtime on the developers' machines for seamless debugging and testing.

Code of this project is [open-source](https://github.com/beehive-lab/tornado-insight).
Plugin is available in [Jetbrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23309-tornadoinsight).
