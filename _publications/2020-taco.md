In this article, we present FastPath_MP, a novel low-overhead and energy-efficient storage multi-path architecture that leverages FPGAs to operate transparently to the main processor and improve the performance and energy efficiency of accessing storage devices. We prototyped FastPath_MP on both Arm-FPGA Zynq 7000 SoC and Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC and evaluated its performance against standard microbenchmarks as well as the real-world in-memory Redis database. Our results show that FastPath_MP achieves up to 82% lower latency, up to 12× higher throughput, and up to 10× more energy efficiency against the baseline storage path of the Linux kernel.
