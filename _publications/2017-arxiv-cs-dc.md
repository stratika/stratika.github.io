The end of Dennard scaling combined with stagnation in architectural and compiler optimizations makes it challenging to achieve significant performance deltas. Solutions based solely in hardware or software are no longer sufficient to maintain the pace of improvements seen during the past few decades. In hardware, the end of single-core scaling resulted in the proliferation of multi-core system architectures, however this has forced complex parallel programming techniques into the mainstream. To further exploit physical resources, systems are becoming increasingly heterogeneous with specialized computing elements and accelerators. Programming across a range of disparate architectures requires a new level of abstraction that programming languages will have to adapt to. In software, emerging complex applications, from domains such as Big Data and computer vision, run on multi-layered software stacks targeting hardware with a variety of constraints and resources. Hence, optimizing for the power-performance (and resiliency) space requires experimentation platforms that offer quick and easy prototyping of hardware/software co-designed techniques. To that end, we present Project Beehive: A Hardware/Software co-designed stack for runtime and architectural research. Project Beehive utilizes various state-of-the-art software and hardware components along with novel and extensible co-design techniques. The objective of Project Beehive is to provide a modern platform for experimentation on emerging applications, programming languages, compilers, runtimes, and low-power heterogeneous many-core architectures in a full-system co-designed manner.
