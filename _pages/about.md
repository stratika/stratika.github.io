I am a Research Fellow at the University of Manchester with specialization on heterogeneous architectures and reconfigurable accelerators. My research interests include computer architecture, high-performance computing, virtualization and hardware acceleration on various deployments ranging from IoT, Edge to Cloud. 

I am currently involved in the EU Horizon 2020 [ELEGANT](https://www.elegant-h2020.eu/) project to make [TornadoVM](https://www.tornadovm.org/) the norm for developing applications that can be transparently accelerated on both IoT and Cloud execution environments. Additionally, I am involved in the EU Horizon Europe [TANGO](https://tango-project.eu/) as an innovation manager. Finally, I am the dissemination officer of the EU Horizon Europe [AERO](https://aero-project.eu/) project which aims to bring up and optimize a software stack capable of operating on top of the emerging EU cloud processor.

Finally, I am an Impact Champion at the University of Manchester aiming to facilitate researchers of the university towards productizing their research ideas.
