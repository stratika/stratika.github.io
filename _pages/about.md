I am a Research Fellow at the University of Manchester with specialization on heterogeneous architectures and reconfigurable accelerators. My research interests include computer architecture, high-performance computing, virtualization and hardware acceleration on various deployments ranging from IoT, Edge to Cloud. 

Currenlty, I am involved in the EU Horizon Europe [TANGO](https://tango-project.eu/) as an innovation manager. Additionally, I am the dissemination officer of the EU Horizon Europe [AERO](https://aero-project.eu/) project which aims to bring up and optimize a software stack capable of operating on top of the emerging EU cloud processor.

Finally, I am an Impact Champion at the University of Manchester aiming to facilitate researchers of the university towards productizing their research ideas.
